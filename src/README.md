# Spaceships-game

This game was given to us as a timed challenge. We had to implement the content we had provided to us, couple of hours before this challenge. We had to use OOP.
The challenge requirements were:
-Everything needs to be in an HTML file
-The game should be created in less than 200 lines of code.
-(Personal requirement) Have the least HTML lines of code as possible( currently having 3 lines of HTML, everything else is generated by JS).

Every ship gets randomly hit and Health Points are taken off it. If the ship goes to 0 HP, the ship dies and is taken off the screen. If the mothership dies before all other ships, all the ships die!

I have used grid to positin the ships. All the ships have been generated html tags and classes through JS in order for them to be styled.
