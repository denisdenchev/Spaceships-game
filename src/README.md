# Spaceships-game

This game was given to us as a timed challenge. We had to implement the content we had provided to us, couple of hours before this challenge. We had to use OOP.
The challenge requirements were:
-Everything needs to be in an HTML file
-The game should be created in less than 200 lines of code.
-(Personal requirement) Have the least HTML lines of code as possible( currently having 3 lines of HTML, everything else is generated by JS).
